### Description ✏️
This project serves as a landing page for a gaming studio. It offers a fully responsive website with navigation, that works like a sidebar menu on lower-resolution screens. We can also notice some text content with images and a grid system with hover effects for choosing a specific game, as well as a footer at the bottom of the page.

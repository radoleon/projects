### Description ✏️
This project imitates an e-shop that sells electronic goods. From the landing page, the user can get to the products page, where he can choose products, which can be filtered by category. By clicking on each of the products, the user will be redirected to the product details page, where a specific amount of this product can be added to the cart. In the cart, the selected products can be removed, or the order can be completed by clicking on the button. There is also an option to sign up or log in to this website, which allows authenticated users to save their shipping information and view their transactions.
